# Source Coding Project (2018)

Assignment: 

Build coding and decoding procedures for static color images by means of vector quantization.
Use a vector quantizer designed with the LBG-split algorithm with rate R = 8 bit/pixel for vectors of size
L = 3 where the tree components are the (R,G,B) or the (Y,U,V) representation of the color image at 8 x 3
bit/pixel. (Note that this is equivalent to build a “palette” of 256 colors).
Evaluate the performance in terms of distortion for some test images and compare the results with those
obtained using the JPEG standard (an implementation of JPEG is available in MATLAB).
